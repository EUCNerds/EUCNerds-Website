# EUCNerds Website

This repository contains the EUCNerds corporate website (static HTML/CSS/JS). EUC Nerds is a consulting firm specializing in Citrix and Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) solutions. The site is deployed via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) and is fully static.

## Structure

- **`index.html`** – Main homepage (one-page design with sections for services, contact, etc.).  
- **`/img/`** – Image assets (logo and partner technology logos).  
- **Other files** – `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, etc. as needed for SEO.  

No build step is required; simply edit the HTML/CSS and push to the default branch to redeploy.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Ensure the root folder is selected in Pages settings and that your branch (e.g. `main`) is configured. Cloudflare Pages will automatically publish changes on push.
